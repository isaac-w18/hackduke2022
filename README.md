Presenting Care Connect: Care Coordination Made Easy.
Care Connect automates the schedule for caregivers to 'sign-up' for caregiving slots. These slots include car rides to the doctor's office, bringing food, ensuring the patient drinks water, and regular check-ups, as well as slots that patient may request themselves. Beyond scheduling, Care Connect provides in-app communication, tracking and notifications for medication, food, and water, and education for patients.
